# movie_data_analysis
This project deals with analysing movie actors data set by designing a cumulative data model. 
1. Construct a series of SQL queries and table definitions that will allow us to model the actor_films dataset in a way that facilitates efficient analysis.
2. This involves creating new tables, defining data types, and writing queries to populate these tables with data from the actor_films dataset.
3. Implementing SCD Type 2 and incrementally load new data
